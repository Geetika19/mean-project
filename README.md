# Blogxer - Blogging Platform
This website will provide users to write their own blogs and even connect with blogging 
community. This product is inspired from Blogging websites like Medium but with main 
priority given to authorized and authenticated content. It is a better implementation where 
users can log in our website and read and share Blogs of their own interests and with a 
perspective of making communication easier a user can follow other person and can share 
thoughts easily. We have a thought of publishing authenticated content on our website 
where other people can read each others blogs and can give comments and like the Blog. 
To look like social media we added a profile section where the person can keep a track of 
his own activities and can also get the notifications if people react on his/her blogs. The 
Website has proper login and register options which people have to perform before 
accessing the main features of our website. Even there is a contact us option which will 
help us to connect with users of our website if they have any queries regarding accessing 
our website. Basically this project is created with the purpose of learning new 
technologies and understanding how things work in real world.
